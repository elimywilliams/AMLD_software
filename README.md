# AMLD Software

The only files that need to be edited when you want to run the algorithm is:

The config file: *amld_config.yaml*. After that, just run the *runAMLD.py* file.

The packages requirements are found in the *requirements.txt*

A few example files are in the **example** folder - you can use this to make sure the algorithm is running correctly.
